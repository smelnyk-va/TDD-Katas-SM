The PrimeComposite Kata

- Write a program that prints numbers within specified range lets say 1 to 100.
- If number is ```prime``` print 'prime' instead of the number.
- If number is ```composite``` but not ```even``` print 'composite' instead of number.
- Else print number.

Steps

- Prints numbers from 1 to 100.
- Print "Prime" instead of number, if the number is prime, means ```number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself```.
- Print "Composite" instead of number, if the number is composite, means ```number has at least one positive divisor other than one or the number itself. In other words, a composite number is any integer greater than one that is not a prime number``` but not a ```even number```.
- An even number is ```an integer is even if it is 'evenly divisible' by two```.
- Print number, if it does not meet above two conditions.
- Make method to accept any number of range [currently  we have 1 to 100].
- Create a new method to check Prime/Composite of a single supplied method.
